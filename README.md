# Open Margins: Evaluating Limits of PBAD Against Sensor Attacks
## Paper Abstract
Cyber-physical systems have been the center of proactive research in defense against spoofing attacks. Spoofing attacks allow an adversary to gain implicit control of systems actuation by injecting false signals. Software defenses have been a popular approach for defending against sensor spoofing in resource constrained deployments as processing power has become cheaper. A popular approach that continues to see development even to today is physics-based attack detection, a software defense that models a system and checks for anomalous behavior against the model. Although there is frequent improvement in the space of physics-based attack detection, little to none of the work models the defense and extends to abstract systems. Without a statistical analysis the actual guarantees of physics-based attack detection is unknown, potentially seeing real deployments having little impact due to system parameterization. We focus our work on developing a general model of physics-based attack detection and statistically analyzing the model to provide guarantees for the detector. Concretely, we develop a method that determines minimum requirements for a sensor based on detector and attack parameters that will make the system guarantee specified performance.
